# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: Function is an action in coding to make the code start to do something.

  Researched answer: Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map is global and filter is local.

  Researched answer: They do different things: . filter() returns a subset of the elements from the original array, while . map() produces an array with new, different entries based on the elements in the original array



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() is used for programmers to see the result in the console or terminal and return is used to give the return back from the action you wanted to result to.

  Researched answer: return is a statement that allows a function to output a value back to where it was called. console. log is a function that lets us inspect values for debugging purposes.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is the () after the function has been called and is used to put in what the function is going to bring into it.

  Researched answer: Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: You have a driver and a navigator. The driver is the one typing and operating the computer, while the navigator is looking for errors and helping with the overall logic of the code.

  Researched answer:
Pair programming is an important technique for developing higher quality code, faster while also reducing risk and spreading knowledge in an organization. With pair programming, two software developers work on one computer, collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code, or test


6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: Test driven development and the work flow is to make sure that the code made to fail at first, then to come up with a code that would pass the test.

  Researched answer:
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a programming practice that instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed. This avoids duplication of code. ... The simple concept of TDD is to write and correct the failed tests before writing new code (before development)


7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: giving that extra 5 - 10 mins to finish up on challenges was helpful midweek.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React: A javascript library for building user interfaces

- Yarn: is a package manager for code. It allows developers to use eachothers code.

- React State: React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

- CRUD: create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage

- this: this (also called self or Me ) is a variable that is used in instance methods to refer to the object on which they are working
